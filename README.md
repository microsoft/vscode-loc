# Visual Studio Code Language Packs

This repository contains files to build localized Language Pack extensions for Visual Studio Code. A Language Pack contains the localized string resources for a particular language. 

Localized resource files are managed and edited in Microsoft Localization Community. Files will be exported to this repository when prepare the publishing of language pack.

Language pack extensions are published to the [Visual Studio Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/search?target=VSCode&category=Language%20Packs&sortBy=Installs)

There are 13 "Core" languages for Visual Studio Code.
Previous 3 additional community driven languages are putting on hold while we are looking for the way how community can contribute.
