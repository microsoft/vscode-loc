# Visual Studio Code Language Packs

This repository contains all of the localized Language Pack extensions for Visual Studio Code. A Language Pack contains the localized string resources for a particular language. 

Localized resource files are managed in [Microsoft Localization Community Platform (MLCP)](https://envelope-community.azurewebsites.net/).

There are 9 "Core" languages for Visual Studio Code and, currently, 5 additional community driven languages:

## Contributing Translations

Visual Studio Code translations are done in the [Visual Studio Code Project in MLCP](https://aka.ms/vscodeloc). MLCP is the single source of "truth", therefore any changes need to be made there. This repository is for building the language pack extensions.
