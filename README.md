# Visual Studio Code Language Packs

This repository contains all of the localized Language Pack extensions for Visual Studio Code. A Language Pack contains the localized string resources for a particular language. 

Localized resource files are managed in [Microsoft Localization Community Platform (MLCP)](https://envelope-community-staging.azurewebsites.net/).

## Contributing Translations

VS Code translations are done in the [VS Code Project in MLCP](https://aka.ms/vscodeloc). MLCP is the single source of "truth", therefore any changes need to be made there. This repository is for building the language pack extensions.
