# Visual Studio Code Language Packs

Visual Studio Code is localized into many different languages using the concept of Language Packs. Language Packs can be installed by running the `>Configure Display Language` command in Visual Studio Code's Command Palette or installed via the [Visual Studio Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/search?target=VSCode&category=Language%20Packs&sortBy=Installs).

The original English strings can be found in the source code of the [open source repository](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode) and the localized strings for supported languages can be found in this repository.

Localized resource files are managed and edited by Microsoft. Files will be exported to this repository when strings are updated to prepare for the publishing of language pack.

There are currently 14 supported languages for Visual Studio Code.

## Contributing

If you want to give feedback or report an issue with a translation, please create a [new GitHub issue](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-loc/issues/new). Please check if a topic about your issue already exists!
Translation strings are managed on the Microsoft Localization Platform, and changes to strings can only be made there. Consequently, pull requests fixing translations won't be accepted. All other PRs to things like `README.md`, `package.json`, etc. will be accepted at the discretion of the maintainers.

## Legal

Before we can accept your pull request you will need to sign a **Contribution License Agreement**. All you need to do is to submit a pull request, then the PR will get appropriately labelled (e.g. `cla-required`, `cla-norequired`, `cla-signed`, `cla-already-signed`). If you already signed the agreement we will continue with reviewing the PR, otherwise system will tell you how you can sign the CLA. Once you sign the CLA all future PR's will be labeled as `cla-signed`.
